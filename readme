gridface


This directory contains face(6) files for faces(1).  You can bind this
directory to the location you want ($home/lib/face or /lib/face is
preferred).

USAGE INFORMATION

TL;DR: Put your files in their directory and run mk.

The general hierarchy is described by face(6).  You must name your
face like your email address (user@example.com, so for example
face/48x48x8/u/user@example.com).

After that, navigate to the root face directory (the one with the
mkfile) and run mk.  mk then extracts the filenames and builds working
.dict files.

BUGS AND NOT-SO-NICE THINGS

If you find bugs or errors, or find ways to optimize and improve the
mkfile, feel free to do it.  The files will be hosted at
https://github.com/sirjofri/gridface, it's best to just put it there.
